### Expense Tracker Application

#### Description
This project is a secure and robust **Expense Tracker API** built with **FastAPI**. It enables users to manage expenses efficiently, featuring functionalities like expense and category management, user authentication, and validation. I have also experimented with creating a **Svelte-based frontend** for this API: [Expense Tracker UI](https://github.com/mamhaini/expense-tracker-ui).
